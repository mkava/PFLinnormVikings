# Adventure Summary
There will be combat against humans, larger enemies (trolls and giants), undead, and wild and magical animals. Fey are common throughout the region, especially near Grungir Forest, so social skills and a quick wit are beneficial. Wilderness travel will be common across tundra, sea, mountains (possibly extreme elevation), and possibly moors and swamps.

The Linnorm Kingdoms is a tough and unforgiving place. Resilience in all things will matter. As an example, to become a king of the region, one must slay a linnorm, a primeval dragon originally from the First World that thrives on the hatred of what it sees as lesser beings. A small linnorm is 60 feet long and 12,000 pounds. There is a prophecy that the hero that slays the Father of all Linnorm, Fafnheir, will become the king of all the Ulfen people, yet none who have tried have ever returned.

# The Setting
The campaign is located in the Land of the Linnorm Kings, the frozen homeland of the Ulfen people and a kingdom as wild and untamed as the people who spawned it. Full of wilderness and monsters, this is a tough but diverse land to live in. The Ulfen people are known throughout the Inner Sea region as bloodthirsty savages and raiders and for their legendary battle lust, but this simply isn't true. In fact, the Ulfens tend to be thoughtful in their pursuits be it planning a raid, establishing defenses of a village or a hold, or as bodyguards. Honorable behavior, by their definition, is highly held in their culture and the taking of life unnecessarily is a waste. Ulfen traditionally keep thralls, a form of legalized time-limited slavery, that are either captured during battle (and not sold back for their weregild or ransom price) or are condemned for a heinous crime. Unlike most parts of the world, being a lycanthrope is seen as a blessing since it shows a strong connection to the nature. Those cursed with such a disease often spend the full moon nights locked in a longhouse overnight with a full stock of food provided by their countrymen to handle their immense hunger.

## Religion
There are five common religions to the region: Desna, Erastil, Gorum, Pharasma, and Torag. Sailors also often worship Gozreh, a dualistic deity of nature, a god of the storm and sky and also a goddess of the wave and surf. There are is also ancestor worship and animism, but that is much less common. Across the border into Irrisen, religion and such devotion is not allowed under the reign of Baba Yaga's offspring.
- [Desna](http://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Desna) (CG) is the Tender of Dreams and Mother Moon. She embodies freedom and luck in all things and is known as the Goddess of Travel and Journeys. Most Ulfen women follow Desna. Most halfings have a special affection for Desna, especially those that value travel and adventure.
- [Erastil](http://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Erastil) (LG) is known as Old Deadeye or the Stag God. Most farmers and hunters and the occasional tradesman worship Erastil.
- [Gorum](http://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Gorum) (CN), Our Lord in Iron, is the very basis of battle and often known as the god of war. Those who worship him claim to see Gorum take their life in battle or have him ride at their side in a charge. Warriors and those who live and die the sword are his common followers.
- [Pharasma](http://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Pharasma) (N) is the Lady of Graves, the one who weighs and measures all in the afterlife at the top of her grand spire in the Boneyard. Pharasma is also the goddess of birth and prophecy: from the moment a creature is born, she sees what its ultimate fate will be, but reserves final judgement until that soul finally stands before her. As the goddess of death and rebirth, she abhors the undead and considers them a perversion. Her followers include midwives, morticians, and those against undeath.
- [Torag](http://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Torag) (LG) is a stoic and serious god who values honor, planning, and well-made steel. He is an often distant deity, lending magical power to his clerics, but leaving his followers to make their own way through life, knowing that this will make them strong and determined. While others do worship this dwarven god, dwarves follow him the most passionately as they see him as their maker and the dwarven ideal.

## Langauges
Skald is the native language of the Land of the Linnorm Kings. Alko, Common, Dwarf, Giant, Gnome, Orc, Sylvan, and Tien are also spoken in different regions.

## Races
- **Humans**
    - [Ulfen](http://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ulfen_(human_ethnicity)) - Natives to the Land of the Linnorm Kings.
    - Taldor - People of a formerly major empire that has fallen from glory, now rival nobles battle each other with bitter knights and proxy armies for personal power rather than honor. Their language Taldane is the most common language, especially for trade, is actually known as Common.
    - Aldoran - A freedom loving people from a nation that sees itself as the birthplace of freedom. Governed by the principle of Common Rule which grants every citizen a voice. Nation was formerly part of the Taldor empire.
    - Irrisen - The people of Irrisen generally trace their heritage to one of two sources: they are either descended from the Ulfen that were enslaved by Baba Yaga or they are distantly descended from one of Irrisen's previous queens.
    - Varisian - A primarily nomadic people that favor the open road instead of established permanent settlements. Commonly travel around in caravans. Currently in the country of Varisia but commonly found in Ustalav too. Appear to be frivilious, but have a fierce loyalty to family and friends.
    - Tian - Best described as of asian descent, originally from a continent (Tian Xia ie Dragon Empires) on the other side of the world from the Inner Sea. Fastest route to the Land of the Linnorm Kings is over the top of the world over the Teeth of the World. Members of this culture are present along the Path of Aganhei in small villages and found in greater numbers in the Jade District of Kalsgard, the capital of the Thanelands.
- **Dwarves** - Common on the eastern side of the realm and in the mines of Kopperberget, dwarves are also found in the Ironbound Isles where their trade skills are very profitable and warring with hated giants throughout Southmoor. Dwarves have been found in the region since before the Winter War that loss the eastern reaches of the Land of the Linnorm Kings to the Irrisen.
- **Elves** - Not common in the Land of the Linnorm Kings. Some live north in the Teeth of the World, but little is known about them that they are usually thought to be a myth instead of fact.
- **Gnomes** - Originally of the First World, but left for some unknown reason. This loss of connection leads to a horrible disease if a gnome is not leading an exciting enough life called the Bleaching. Bleaching is usually fatal, but in rare cases, a gnome survives and is a dull reflection of their past selves. Due to the connection between the First World and Golarian (the planet) is strongest in the Land of the Linnorm Kings, it is not uncommon for gnomes to live their lives in this realm as they are invogorated by the closeness of the First World. Gnomes living in the region, especially around Grungir Forest and the town of Delmon's Glen, commonly negotiate the misgivings between the fey and humans.

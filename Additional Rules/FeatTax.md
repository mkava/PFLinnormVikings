# House Rule: Feat Tax Removal
As a tentative house rule, I am going to try something different than I have in prior campaigns I have ran. I am going to attempt to resolve an issue of feat tax by allowing a select few feats to be given as 'free options' as long as the prereqs are met. An example of this is Combat Expertise: it is a feat required to acquire more specialized feats and can be useful by itself, but not everyone wants or will remember to use Combat Expertise plus it fills a feat slot that could have otherwise been spent on something more meaningful/powerful. So the below feats will be changed to be available for free if the prereqs have been met. Format is "Name: (Prereqs) Description"

- **[Weapon Finesse](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-finesse-combat---final):** (No prereqs) Use DEX instead of STR on attack rolls with light weapons.
- **[Combat Expertise](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/combat-expertise-combat):** (INT 13) Trade attack bonus for AC bonus. Needed for Improved combat maneuver.
- **[Power Attack](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/power-attack-combat---final):** (STR 13, BAB +1) Trade melee attack bonus for damage.
- **[Deadly Aim](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/deadly-aim-combat):**  (DEX 13, BAB +1) Trade ranged attack bonus for damage.
- **[Point Blank Shot](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/point-blank-shot-combat---final):** (No prereqs) +1 attack and damage with ranged weapons on targets within 30 feet.
- **[Weapon Focus](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat---final):** (Proficiency with weapon, BAB +1) +1 bonus on attack rolls with weapon group. This applies [Martial Mastery](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/racial-feats/martial-mastery-combat-human) for free, meaning that Weapon Focus is really Weapon Group Focus and applies the bonus to weapons in that group instead of just a single weapon. What group a weapon falls into is defined by the weapon groups for fighters using [this master list](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter#TOC-Weapon-Training-Ex-). Example: The Bows group covers all types of bows (long and short, composite and not) while Heavy Blades covers a falcata, a falchion, a greatsword, and a bastard sword (plus the whole rest of the list) all at once.

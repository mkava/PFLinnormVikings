## 1) Choose A Concept
Determine what the concept of the character is. Who are you and what do you want to do?

## 2) Character Sheets
Try out [Character Sheets by Dyslexic Studeos](http://charactersheets.minotaur.cc/). It does print with multiple pages, but has additional detail and per-class page that spells out when abilities are available. Spellcasters will find this especially useful.

## 3) Classes
**Allowed Classes:** All Core and Base classes are allowed, unless specified. Vigilante and Gunsligher are not allowed. There will be no firearms in this setting.

**Favored Class and Favored Class Bonus:** Everyone gets a favored class (half-elves get two). This is set at character creation. When gaining a level in a favored class (including first level), the character gains an additional hitpoint or skill point. Each race has an alternate bonus based on the class.

## 4) Races
All Core races are valid, of course. Humans, half-orcs, half-elves, gnomes, and dwarves are fairly common throughout the Land of the Linnorm Kings. There are no native elves, other than those that live among the Teeth of the World.

Inherently good or evil races may have difficulty being accepted culturally. Races of the Underdark, such as the Daergar or Drow, are especially unliked and will have difficulty with the powers that be in the kingdom. If you want to play a race that will have to deal with this strife, talk with me prior to make sure it won't cause conflicts for the table, story, or setting.

## 5) Alignment
No requirements. Full spectrum is allowed. Chaotic characters, especially from other regions, will find it easier to handle the people and cultures present in the campaign. Extremely good or extremely evil will not work in this setting. Please do not create a character that is the moral compass for the party. Strife due to alignment differences is fine though and sometimes part of the fun.

## 6) Ability Scores
We will be using point buy to give everyone the same amount of power potential. Use this [Point Buy Calculator](http://www.jody-white.com/pathfinder-ability-score-calculator.php), select 25 points (Epic Fantasy). Dumping an ability (lowering it below 10) is fine, within reason. This gives more points to buy up other skills.

- Strength (STR) - Raw strength. Melee to hit and damage. How much can be carried.
- Dexterity (DEX) - Finesse and agility. Ranged and ranged touch to hit. Affects AC, touch AC, and reflex save.
- Consitituion (CON) - Physical health and resilience. Affects HP and fortititude (FORT) save.
- Intelligence (INT) - Raw intelligence. Additional skills and languages. Some spellcasters.
- Wisdom (WIS) - Mental health and resilience. Some spellcasters. Affects will save.
- Charisma (CHA) - Force of personality. Some spellcasters.

## 7) Traits
Everyone gets two charater [traits](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits). These other traits cannot be from the same category (magic, social, etc). Optionally, you can take a single [drawback](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/drawbacks) to get another trait.

## 8) Skills
The number of ranks in a skill is limited by your total class level. Only one rank in any skill at first level.

Everyone starts with a rank in a single Profession, this is an extra skill rank earned during character creation for free. This represents the profession that your character has that learns them a honest living.

Don't forget class skills that have at least one rank in it have an extra bonus +3 (this is shown as a separate column on the Dyslexic Studeos character sheet).

## 9) Feats
Everyone starts with an extra bonus feat.

## 10) Starting HP
Maximum HP at first level. So a wizard with a d6 gets 6 + CON modifier.
Minimum lower half on HD roll every level after. Example: Roll 1d6, minimum result 3.

## 11) Starting Gold and Equipment
Set average for starting class. Example: Sorcerer gets 70gp, Cleric gets 140gp.

## 12) Movement, Saves, Initiative, Attack Bonuses, Other Details
Fill in the respective statistics.

### Movement
Medium characters start with 30 ft movement speed and small characters start with 20 ft movement speed. Usually no climb, fly, or swim speeds.

### Saves
Saves combine your natural ability (ability score modifiers) and your class's training.
- Fort Save = Base + CON modifier + Equipment + Misc/Traits
- Reflex Save = Base + DEX modifier + Equipment + Misc/Traits
- Will Save = Base + WIS modifier + Equipment + Misc/Traits

#### Melee
- To Hit: (STR + Base Attack Bonus) + Feats + Weapon Qualities
- Damage: STR + Weapon + Feats + Weapon Qualities
    - Feats such as Power Attack add additional damage.
    - Weapon Qualities is masterwork (to hit), magic
    - Two-handed weapons deal 1.5 x STR, rounded down. STR +3 means 3+1=4 while +4 means 4+2=6

### Ranged
- To Hit: (DEX + Base Attack Bonus) + Feats + Weapon Qualities
- Damage: Weapon + Feats + Weapon Qualities
    - Feats such as Point Blank Shot add additional damage.
    - Weapon Qualities is masterwork (to hit), magic, composite
    - Composite longbows have a strength quality that add additional damage.

### Other Details
Age, height, and weight are defined by your race. For your race, there is an adulthood age chart based on the class type (Intuitive, Self-Taught, Trained) that should give an idea of what age is appropriate for the race/class combination.

# Reminders!
- Ability modifiers only change on even ability scores. Modifier = (Score - 10) / 2, Round Down. 16 => 3, 15 = 2, 9 => -1, 8 => -1
- At 4th-level and every 4 after that (8th, 12th, etc), any ability score can be increased by a single value (16 => 17). This is a permament increase and doesn't need to apply to the same ability score every time.
- There exists magical spells and equipment that can boost ability scores, such as Bull's Strength and Belt of Giant Strength for Strength respectively.
- Spellcasters linked ability score must be at least 10 higher than the spell to cast it. Example: A wizard needs an INT score of 16 to cast a 6th-level spell. An INT score of 15 or less means the wizard cannot cast 6th-level or higher spells. Take this into account when assigning ability scores.
    - Intelligence (INT) for Wizards, Magus, Witch, Alchemist
    - Wisdom (WIS) for Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Inquisitor
    - Charisma (CHA) for Sorcerer, Bard, Paladin, Oracle, Summoner, Cleric's channels/day
